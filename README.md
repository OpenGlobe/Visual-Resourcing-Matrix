"You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes." The term redpill refers to a human that is aware of the true nature of the Matrix." - [The Matrix](http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Redpill)

# Visual-Resourcing-Matrix
Simple way to clue others in on your availability.

## What it is
Use a simple emoji to visually represent your availability to your team in Slack.

## What it means
Red pill = I'm bending time and reality and entirely plugged in to the Matrix - I'm in the rabbit hole (or, I'm maxed out at the moment and not available to help on other projects)

Blue pill = Things are rather chill right now (or, I have a few cycles to spare if you need some help on your project)

##How it works
From Slack:

1. Click on name
2. View profile and account
3. Click Edit button
4. In Last Name field, click next to the end of your name or airport code, then CRTL+CMD+SPACE on Mac to open emoticon window
5. Add the red or blue pill
6. Save changes

##Variations

Red --> Blue = busy now, have time coming up
Blue --> Red = have time now, but not for long
Red Red = I'm so busy pulling crazy moves on my project I unfortunately have next to no time to sleep.
